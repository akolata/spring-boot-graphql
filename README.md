Spring for GraphQL supports server handling of GraphQL requests over HTTP, WebSocket, and RSocket.

Requests must use HTTP POST with "application/json" as content type and GraphQL request details included as JSON in the
request body, as defined in the proposed GraphQL over HTTP specification. Once the JSON body has been successfully
decoded, the HTTP response status is always 200 (OK), and any errors from GraphQL request execution appear in the "
errors" section of the GraphQL response. The default and preferred choice of media type is "
application/graphql-response+json", but "application/json" is also supported, as described in the specification.

As a protocol GraphQL focuses on the exchange of textual data. This doesnâ€™t include binary data such as images, but
there is a separate, informal graphql-multipart-request-spec that allows file uploads with GraphQL over HTTP.
